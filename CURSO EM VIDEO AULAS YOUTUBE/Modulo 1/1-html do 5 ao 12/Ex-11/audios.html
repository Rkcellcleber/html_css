           Hey Nikita, is it cold
            In your little corner of the world?
            You could roll around the globe
            And never find a warmer soul to know
            Oh, I saw you by the wall
            Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
            With eyes that looked like ice on fire
            The human heart a captive in the snow
            Oh, Nikita, you will never know
            Anything about my home
            I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
            Nikita, I need you so
            Oh, Nikita is the other side
            Of any given line in time
            Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
            Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know
            Do you ever dream of me
            Do you ever see the letters that I write
            When you look up through the wire
            Nikita, do you count the stars at night
            And if there comes a time
            Guns and gates no longer hold you in
            And if you're free to make a choice
            Just look towards the west and find a friend
            Oh, Nikita, you will never know
            Anything about my home
            I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
            Nikita, I need you so
            Oh, Nikita, is the other side
            Of any given line in time
            Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
            Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know
            Oh, Nikita, you will never know
            Never know anything about my home
            I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
            Nikita I need you so
            Oh, Nikita, is the other side
            Of any given line in time
            Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
            Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know
            (Nikita) counting ten tin soldiers in a row
            (Nikita) counting ten tin soldiers in a row
            (Nikita) counting ten tin soldiers in a row
